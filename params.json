{"name":"OViews","body":"OViews\r\n========\r\n\r\nViews that observe your model for changes and render accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis project depends on Dojo being included in the project and named 'dojo' in your packages.\r\n\r\n### Usage ###\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrequire([ 'template/sample-template', 'OView' ], function ( sampleTemplate, OView ) {\r\n\r\n  // Your Initial Data (At minimum, an empty array must be passed in)\r\n  var sampleData = [\r\n    {id: 0, info: 'Sample Data 0'}\r\n  ];\r\n\r\n  var cssSelector = '#sample-div'\r\n\r\n  // Instatiated a new OView\r\n  var sampleOView = new OView({\r\n    initialData: sampleData,\r\n    view: sampleTemplate,\r\n    selector: cssSelector\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // I like to return the model (store) so including this module can interact directly with the DataStore\r\n  return sampleOView.model;\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building ###\r\n\r\nBuilding requires Grunt.js be installed\r\n\r\nIf you are using NPM, install the them with\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g grunt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build process generates a minified file named `main.js` in the root of the project.\r\nThe reason for this is that RequireJS and the Dojo Loader look for `main.js` unless otherwise specified.\r\nThis is mainly for cloning this repo directly and not using CPM.\r\n\r\n### Change Log ###\r\n\r\n2012 05 10 - **Initial OViews Commit - v0.1.0**\r\n\r\n* Basic implementation\r\n* Some test coverage\r\n* Simple List Example to demonstrate usage\r\n* Gruntfile for build process (remove build)\r\n* Jade templates working\r\n\r\n2012 02 19 - **Modified For My Use**\r\n\r\n* Tweak commonjs-package-template to better suit my needs\r\n\r\n### License ###\r\nThe MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Blaine Bublitz <blaine@iceddev.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
